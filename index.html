                        Hello! I'm Zachary Lyski. A prospecting full-stack software developer. I am born and raised in Portland, Oregon. After graduating high school from Arts And Communications Magnet Academy, I started working as a professional dancer overseas in both Japan and Hong Kong. I've worked in Asia as a professional dancer for the past seven and a half years. While living there I learned Japanese and basic Mandarin Chinese. I discovered I have a passion for learning languages. This eventually led to my interest in learning programming languages. I love learning new languages, improving upon my existing knowledge, and working with people from different backgrounds.
